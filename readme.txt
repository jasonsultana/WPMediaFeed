WPYoutubeFeed is a simple plugin that letâ€™s you load a feed of videos automatically from a supplied Youtube channel and display the videos on a page.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to load a feed of videos from your Youtube channel and display them (playable) on a Wordpress page. It works by downloading the HTML of your youtube channel, searching for video links and outputting the standard Youtube video embed code for each of them. Theoretically, it could work for playlists or subscriptions too - basically any page that contains a series of links to Youtube videos. 

This plugin requires the Wordpress-Settings-Library package to be installed in the plugins directory.


== Installation ==

To install and use this plugin:

1. Upload `WPYoutubeFeed` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Settings->WPYoutubeFeed and enter the URL of your Youtube channel.
